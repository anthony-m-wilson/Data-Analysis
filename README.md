# Data-Analysis
Final group project for Data Analytics class (DATA 3300). The purpose of this exercise is to gain practice running and interpreting a business analytics project from start to finish. This will require students to do everything from cleaning and analyzing a dataset to visualizing trends and making recommendations to inform business decisions.

## Background
For this assignment, students will use the manager_performance.csv data set.

This file contains data collected by a human resource director on managers of a large national firm. The goal will be to predict the outcome of a manager’s performance evaluation based on a number of individual characteristics.

The firm is growing rapidly, and the HR director will be hiring several new managers within the next few months.  He has collected data on existing managers that he would like to use to build a model that predicts how well prospective managers will perform. The data includes indicators of employment history (how long the manager has worked for the company and number of previous management positions), ratings of personal characteristics such as motivation and leadership, and the outcome of each manager’s most recent performance evaluation. 

## Data Set
The attributes in the dataset include:

- **Manager_ID:** Unique identifier for each manager
- **First_Name:** First name of employee
- **Last_Name:** Last name of employee
- **Age:** Age of employee in years
- **Time_Employed:** The number of years the manager has worked for the company
- **Num_Prev_Positions:** The number of previous management positions held by the manager before working for the company
- **Teamwork:** An aggregate peer rating of overall ability to work in a team (1-10, with 10 being the highest teamwork ability)
- **Motivation:** An aggregate peer rating of overall motivation (1-10, with 10 being the highest motivation)
- **Leadership:** An aggregate peer rating of overall ability to lead (1-10, with 10 being the highest leadership ability)
- **Performance_Evaluation (target):** The manager’s rating on the most recent performance evaluation by their direct superior (High/Low)
